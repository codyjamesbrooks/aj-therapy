        <h3>Healthcare workers</h3>
        <p>Healthcare workers dedicate their lives to caring for others, and that can take a toll on their own wellbeing. I have been specializing in working with healthcare professionals since 2019. From 2019 to 2025 I practiced at a psychotherapy clinic where 80% of our clientele were in the healthcare field. Through this work I developed a deep understanding of the unique emotional and logistical challenges that come with these demanding careers.</p>
        <p>I have particular expertise in supporting residents and fellows. Residency comes with immense pressure—secondary trauma from patient care, an overwhelming workload, loss of control over your schedule, moral distress, and the struggle to maintain relationships and personal interests outside of work. These challenges can impact your mental health, self-worth, and ability to find joy in your personal and professional life.</p>
        <p>My approach is compassionate, practical, and tailored to the realities of working in medicine. Therapy can be a space where you process difficult experiences, reconnect with your values, and build strategies to navigate stress in a sustainable way. To help make therapy more accessible, I offer a 15% discounted rate to residents and fellows.</p>
        <p>If you're looking for support in navigating the complexities of your role as a healthcare professional, I invite you to reach out. You don’t have to carry this alone.</p>
