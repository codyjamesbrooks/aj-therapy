        <h3>Healthcare workers</h3>
        <p>Healthcare workers dedicate their lives to caring for others, and that can take a toll on their own wellbeing. Residency comes with particular challenges â€“ an overwhelming workload, loss of control over your schedule, moral distress, and the struggle to maintain personal interests and relationships outside of work</p>
        <p>I have been specializing in therapy with healthcare professionals, with a particular focus on medical trainees, since 2019. Through this work I developed a deep understanding of the unique emotional and logistical challenges that come with these demanding careers.</p>
        <p>My approach is compassionate, practical, and tailored to the realities of working in medicine. Therapy can be a space where you process difficult experiences, reconnect with your values, and build strategies to navigate stress in a sustainable way.</p>
        <p>To help make therapy more accessible, I offer a 15% discounted rate to medical students, residents and fellows.</p>
