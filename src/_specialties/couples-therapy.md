        <h3>Couples therapy</h3>
        <p>Our relationships shape so much of our happiness and wellbeing, and when things aren’t working with our romantic partner(s), it can feel deeply painful and overwhelming. Whether you’re facing recurring conflict, struggling with communication, or feeling disconnected, therapy can offer a path toward greater understanding, intimacy and healing.</p>
        <p>I provide a safe and affirming space where each person feels heard, valued, and supported. My approach centers on helping couples cultivate mutual empathy and compassion, as I believe that true change happens when both partners can fully see and understand each other. Through this process, we work together to build a healthier, more fulfilling relationship dynamic.</p>
        <p>I support individuals and couples across the spectrum of gender, sexuality, and relationship diversity (GSRD), including LGBTQIA+ identities. I also have a particular specialization in working with new parents, who often face unique stressors as they navigate the profound life changes that come with raising a child.</p>
        <p>No matter what challenges you and your partner(s) are facing, you don’t have to navigate them alone. Therapy can help you rebuild trust, improve communication, and strengthen your connection in meaningful ways.</p>
