        <h3>Sex therapy</h3>
        <p>Struggling with sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, erection, ejaculation or overall confidence and comfort with sex is common. You are not alone, and overcoming these issues is possible. These struggles can be related to anxiety, discomfort with our bodies or pleasure, or previous negative sexual experiences. We often feel shame or embarrassment when talking about sex, even with our romantic and sexual partners. I offer an authentic, accepting and collaborative space for individuals who are seeking therapy to work through some of these issues.</p>
        <p>Sexual health is fundamental to our mental health and overall wellbeing. My goal as a therapist is to support and guide you to feeling comfortable, confident and empowered in your life both in and outside of sex. I support individuals and couples across the spectrum of gender, sexuality, and relationship diversity (GSRD), including LGBTQIA+ identities. I believe our social identities (e.g., gender identity, race, religion) and upbringings can subconsciously impact the expectations we develop about sex. When those expectations cause harm I help you build new, healthier narratives about sex.</p>
