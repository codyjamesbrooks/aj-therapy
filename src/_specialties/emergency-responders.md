        <h3>Emergency responders</h3>
        <p>Long shifts, unpredictable schedules, and daily exposure to trauma can take a significant tollâ€”not just on mental health, but also on physical well-being and relationships. Many responders also face stigma or shame around seeking support, making it even harder to reach out for help. I provide a space where law enforcement officers, firefighters, dispatchers, paramedics, and their family members can process these challenges in a way that feels safe, understood, and free of judgment. To help make therapy more accessible, I offer a 15% discounted rate to emergency responders.</p>
        <p>I have been involved in supporting emergency responders since 2016 when I assisted in establishing Responder Strong, a group dedicated to improving mental health resources for those in the field. Through this work and my experience as a therapist I have developed a deep understanding of the unique and demanding nature of emergency response.</p>
