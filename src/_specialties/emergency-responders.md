        <h3>Emergency responders</h3>
        <p>Shift work, high-pressure job responsibilities, and regular exposure to trauma can take a significant toll on mental health and relationships. Many responders also face stigma or shame around seeking support, making it even harder to reach out for help.</p>
        <p>I have been involved in supporting emergency responders since 2016 when I assisted in establishing ResponderStrong, a group dedicated to improving mental health resources for those in the field. Through this work and my experience as a therapist I have developed a deep understanding of the unique and demanding nature of emergency response.</p>
        <p>I provide a space where law enforcement officers, firefighters, dispatchers, paramedics, victim services advocates and their family members can process these challenges in a way that feels safe and free of judgment.</p>
        <p>To help make therapy more accessible, I offer a 15% discounted rate to emergency responders.</p>
