        </span>I’m a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) based in Colorado, where I’ve been supporting individuals and couples since 2016. I hold dual Master’s degrees in Social Work (MSW) and Public Health (MPH) from the University of Michigan.</p>
      <p>As a therapist, I’m passionate about helping people lead lives that feel meaningful — where they can show up as their authentic selves and align their actions with the person they want to be. My approach draws primarily from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), while also incorporating elements of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and Motivational Interviewing to tailor treatment to each individual’s needs. I welcome individuals and couples across the spectrum of gender, sexuality, and relationship diversity (GSRD), including LGBTQIA+ identities.</p>
      <p>My career has taken me across a range of settings, both domestically and internationally — from after-school and wilderness therapy programs to outpatient and HIV clinics. These diverse experiences have deepened my expertise in working with sexual health and relationships, intimate partner violence, trauma, emergency responders, and healthcare workers.</p>
      <p>I moved to Colorado in 2016 to have more opportunities to rock climb, hike, and ski — activities that continue to ground me outside of my work (while still keeping my home state of Michigan close to my heart).</p>
