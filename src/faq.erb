        <h4>What is your cancellation policy?</h4>
        <p>I ask that you provide at least 24 hours notice if you are going to cancel your session. A cancellation with less than 24 hours notice provided will be charged the full session fee. A no show is defined as being more than 15 minutes late for a session and will be charged the full session fee.</p>
